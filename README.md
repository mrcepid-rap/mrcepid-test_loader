# Test Module for MRCEPID-RunAssociationTesting

This is a blank module that allows for testing the functionality of the interfaces included in 
mrcepid-runassociationtesting independently of any real module. It has no additional options or parameters and thus 
implements only the functionality the interfaces provide.
