# Test Module for MRCEPID-RunAssociationTesting

This is a blank module that allows for testing the functionality of the interfaces included in 
mrcepid-runassociationtesting independently of any real module. It has no additional options or parameters and thus 
implements only the functionality the interfaces provide.

## Changelog

* v1.0.1
  * Implemented CommandExecutor
  * Fixed bug where output received a str rather than a Path

* v1.0.0
  * Initial release
